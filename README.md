# Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game with CPU and User Modes

## Project Description
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built in Python, offering two modes of play:
1. User vs User – where two players take turns inputting their moves.
2. User vs CPU – where the user plays against a computer opponent that makes random valid moves.

The goal is to practice Python fundamentals, work with conditionals, loops, and logic flow, and apply basic AI-like behavior for the CPU. This project is part of the IS 3020 Application Development course at Kennesaw State University.
